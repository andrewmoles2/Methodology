# Methodology

This repository is for LSE Methodology students who are having difficulty getting R + RStudio working for there exercises. 

We have set up a cloud based RStudio for students which has all the libraries used in the R Methodology sessions installed, as well as all the scripts used for both MY451 and MY465. 

To access the cloud environment click on the following link: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/andrewmoles2/Methodology/main?urlpath=rstudio){:target="_blank"}

Note that it will take up to 5 minutes to build the environment for you. Just leave it to do it's thing and don't refresh the page. If it doesn't load in around 10 minutes refresh the page. 

You will not be able to save your work in this environment. If needed you can export out any scripts to save on your local machine.
